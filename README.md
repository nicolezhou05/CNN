### Project Description
For this project, our team made a chatbot that has some small games, recommendations on books, shows, movies, manga, etc., and can talk to the player. By running the `Woo.java` file, you start the chatbot program. `Chatbot.java` contains the major functions of the chatbot. Other classes contain chatbot's specific functions.

### How to Launch

#### Getting started
To start the program, you have to first run `Woo.java`. It will ask for your friend's name, which you type and enter. Then, it will ask you if you want to do something. Entering "no" ends the program. Entering "yes" brings you to choose whether you want to play some games, get some recommendations, or just chat with the bot. Enter "game" if you want to play games. Enter "rec" if you want some recommendations on books, movies, shows, manga, etc. Enter "chat" if you want to talk to the chatbot.
